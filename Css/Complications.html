		<h1>Complications</h1>
		<p>Because the Macintosh project went haywire, Steve was voted out of his position of CEO of Apple, and was asked to leave. Though this did not sit well with Jobs, he left anyways. John Sculley, previously his marketing director, stepped in as CEO of the company.</p>
		<p>While Apple was first starting, Steve Jobs had a daughter named Lisa (hence the computer LISA). Steve denied that she was his daughter until she was 7, and she later moved in with him as a teenager. He did not marry her mother Chrisann Brennan, as he married another woman named Laurene Powel. They met at Sanford Business School, and moved to Palo Alto, California. They had three children together.</p> 
		<p>The following years after his removal, Steve started an academic computer company called NeXT. NeXT was not very successful, as it was only marketed to schools. Then a special man came to Steve's house and started to talk to him about things to come in the future; the future of Apple.</p>
