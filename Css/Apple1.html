		<h1>Steve Jobs: Apple</h1> 
		<p>Believe it or not, Apple started in a garage; Steve's parent's garage to be exact. Jobs and Wozniak wanted to make technology easy for the average person to use, but more advanced than any other product at the time. In 1976 Jobs and Wozniak started Apple computers. They got to work and along came the Apple 1</p>
		<p>The Apple 1 was a circuit board that was built by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ron Wayne. This was the kickstarter for many exciting and genius products to come.</p>
		<p>The Apple 2 was the next product, an upscale version of the Apple 1. Apple had these great products but no one to market them to. That's where John Sculley comes in.</p>
		<p>Sculley was the "marketing expert" at Pepsi, so Jobs asked him to come to Apple, and he did.</p> 
		<p>Life at Apple was great until Lisa. Apple had invested lots of time and money into this machine, but it never took off. It was too expensive and it had few software applications. Lisa stood for "Local Integrated Software Architecture", but it was also the name of Steve Jobs' daughter. This project put Steve in a hole. Many of the products that came after Lisa had different flaws that made consumers unhappy.</p> 
		<p>Next Apple released the macintosh (or MAC for short). Jobs invested lots of time and money into Macintosh as he was assigned to be head of the Macintosh team. Macintosh was successful, but was not "IBM-compatible".</p>
