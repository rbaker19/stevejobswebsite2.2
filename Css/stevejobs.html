						<h3>My Opinion</h3>
						<p>In my opinion, Steve Jobs was a clever, quick-witted businessman who wouldn't take no for an answer. He always fought for what he believed in and wanted. He will be remembered not only for his achievements, but for how he worked for them. The movie was a great portrayal of Steve Jobs' life and I would watch it again.</p>
