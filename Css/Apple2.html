		<h1>The Comeback</h1> 
		<p>Steve was welcomed back with open arms. When he returned, on June 7, 1997, he became the interim CEO and cleared out his Board of Directors. Steve started to change everything at Apple, back to the way it used to be; but with more advanced technology. He later became the CEO and stayed CEO until his death.
