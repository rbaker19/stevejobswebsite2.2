		<h1>Steve Jobs: Before Apple</h1> 
		<p> Steven Jobs was born on February 24th, 1955 to Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah (John) Jandali who later put him up for adoption. He was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs.  </p>
		<p>Steve attended Homestead High School, and he met his future partner Steve Wozniak. They both had the same enjoyment of electronics. After high school, Jobs attended Reed College, but later dropped out but periodically went to creative design classes. Steve then became a video game designer for Atari in 1974, but did not like having to work for someone, so he traveled to India to "find himself". Once he returned, he and Wozniak decided to create a computer company; Apple. </p>
		<p>Fun fact: Steve Jobs is a fruitarian. His diet consists of only fruit and water.</p>
